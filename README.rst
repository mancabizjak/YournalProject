Project overview 
----------------
Our project's goal is development of an open journal system. As a reference, we will be using some existing solutions and try to implement features that include (in addition to all necesarry requirements)
online submission and management of content, subscription module, email notification, commenting etc.
We discussed which technologies would be best suitable for this project and thought of Ruby on Rails, but the decision is not final yet.
