Project overview 
----------------
Our project's goal is development of an open journal system. As a reference, we will be using some existing solutions and try to implement features that include (in addition to all necesarry requirements)
online submission and management of content, subscription module, email notification, commenting etc.
We have conclusively decided to choose the MEAN stack as our framework and CoffeeScript as our scripting language.
This way we share one language across server and client side. GRUNT takes care of build process such as compiling and optimizing
workflow & project structure suitable for development, testing and production.
