	"abstract" : "High-frequency stimulation of rodent hippocampus induces long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength, whereas low-frequency stimulation induces long-term depression (LTD). Both LTP and LTD require activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs), and a pervasive view has been that which form of plasticity is produced depends on the amount of Ca2+ influx through these receptors. Specifically, large Ca2+ influxes are thought to induce LTP, whereas small influxes induce LTD.",
	"content" : "High-frequency stimulation of rodent hippocampus induces long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength, whereas low-frequency stimulation induces long-term depression (LTD). Both LTP and LTD require activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs), and a pervasive view has been that which form of plasticity is produced depends on the amount of Ca2+ influx through these receptors. Specifically, large Ca2+ influxes are thought to induce LTP, whereas small influxes induce LTD. This hypothesis recently received a major blow when it was reported that MK-801—an NMDAR antagonist that blocks the Ca2+ pore without blocking glutamate binding—failed to inhibit LTD in hippocampal slices from young rats, suggesting NMDARs induce LTD through a metabotropic rather than ionotropic mechanism. Wondering whether this phenomenon was limited to young animals, Babiec et al. examined the effect of MK-801 on LTD in adult mice. Unexpectedly, they found that MK-801 blocked LTD not only in adult mice, but also in young mice. Furthermore, MK-801 inhibited NMDAR-induced activation of downstream signaling pathways involved in LTD.",
