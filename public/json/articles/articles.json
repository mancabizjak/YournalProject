		"abstract" : "A number of European countries have implemented austerity programmes since the onset of the current economic crisis. This paper focuses on fiscal consolidation, a central aspect of such programmes, using the case of Ireland. It investigates the significant role of the mass media in presenting such policies to the public, a role which has so far remained unexamined. Conceiving of the Irish experience over the past few decades as a case of neoliberalisation, it uses a critical political economic conceptualisation of news organisations to consider 431 editorials and opinion articles discussing fiscal consolidation in three leading Irish newspapers between 2008 and 2012.",

This paper focuses on fiscal consolidation, a central aspect of such programmes, using the case of Ireland. It investigates the significant role of the mass media in presenting such policies to the public, a role which has so far remained unexamined. Conceiving of the Irish experience over the past few decades as a case of neoliberalisation, it uses a critical political economic conceptualisation of news organisations to consider 431 editorials and opinion articles discussing fiscal consolidation in three leading Irish newspapers between 2008 and 2012. It finds that the majority of articles present viewpoints in favour of fiscal consolidation and display a preference for spending cuts over tax hikes, which substantiates the claim that Ireland has adopted neoliberal policies to address the crisis. Only a minority of articles oppose fiscal consolidation. These mostly contest specific spending cuts but usually fail to criticise fiscal consolidation itself by calling for economic alternatives, such as Keynesian stimulus. Differences between newspapers are also discussed, highlighting their ideological cleavages.",

		"content" : "The US–Russian Framework for the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons, Syria’s simultaneous accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the decisions subsequently taken by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Executive Council and the United Nations Security Council to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons programme have set in motion a disarmament process that is unique in several ways: it is being implemented under the conditions of a raging civil war; it is applying procedures and mechanisms that build on but also modify the implementation provisions of the CWC as required in this complex situation; and because of these extraordinary circumstances the implementation of CWC requirements is for innovative solutions and an international approach to implementing CWC requirements that involves assistance by a number of countries. This process poses enormous practical and political challenges. But there are also a number of legal issues that should be studied further, including with regard to how the provisions of a global disarmament treaty can be applied in what can only be described as extraordinary circumstances; how the relationship between the United Nations and the OPCW is evolving to meet the challenges of this project; and how arms control law interacts with other bodies of law in such field as humanitarian law, environmental protection and safety of people, and international security.",

		"content" : "G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels contribute to the resting membrane potential of many neurons, including dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). VTA DA neurons are bistable, firing in two modes: one characterized by bursts of action potentials, the other by tonic firing at a lower frequency. Here we provide evidence that these firing modes drive bidirectional plasticity of GIRK channel-mediated currents. In acute midbrain slices of mice, we observed that in vitro burst activation of VTA DA neurons potentiated GIRK currents whereas tonic firing depressed these currents. This plasticity was not specific to the metabotropic receptor activating the GIRK channels, as direct activation of GIRK channels by nonhydrolyzable GTP also potentiated the currents. The plasticity of GIRK currents required NMDA receptor and CaMKII activation, and involved protein trafficking through specific PDZ domains of GIRK2c and GIRK3 subunit isoforms. Prolonged tonic firing may thus enhance the probability to switch into burst-firing mode, which then potentiates GIRK currents and favors the return to baseline. In conclusion, activity-dependent GIRK channel plasticity may represent a slow destabilization process favoring the switch between the two firing modes of VTA DA neurons.",

		"keywords" : ["NMDA Receptor", "LTD", "Mice experiments"],
		"abstract" : "High-frequency stimulation of rodent hippocampus induces long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength, whereas low-frequency stimulation induces long-term depression (LTD). Both LTP and LTD require activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs), and a pervasive view has been that which form of plasticity is produced depends on the amount of Ca2+ influx through these receptors. Specifically, large Ca2+ influxes are thought to induce LTP, whereas small influxes induce LTD.",

Specifically, large Ca2+ influxes are thought to induce LTP, whereas small influxes induce LTD. This hypothesis recently received a major blow when it was reported that MK-801—an NMDAR antagonist that blocks the Ca2+ pore without blocking glutamate binding—failed to inhibit LTD in hippocampal slices from young rats, suggesting NMDARs induce LTD through a metabotropic rather than ionotropic mechanism. Wondering whether this phenomenon was limited to young animals, Babiec et al. examined the effect of MK-801 on LTD in adult mice. Unexpectedly, they found that MK-801 blocked LTD not only in adult mice, but also in young mice. Furthermore, MK-801 inhibited NMDAR-induced activation of downstream signaling pathways involved in LTD.",
